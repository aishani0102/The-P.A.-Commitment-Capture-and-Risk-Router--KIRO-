Speaker 1: Welcome everyone to today's standup meeting. Let's go around and share our updates.

Jane: Thanks. I will finish the API integration by Friday. The work is going well and I'm on track.

John Doe: I need to review Jane's PR before she merges it. Also, we decided to use PostgreSQL for the new feature database. The team agreed this is the best choice for our scalability needs.

Speaker 1: Sounds good. Someone should update the documentation to reflect the PostgreSQL decision.

Alice: I can handle the documentation update. I'll also follow up on the client feedback we received yesterday.

Bob: We need to schedule a follow-up meeting next week to discuss the deployment strategy. I should also check the server capacity before we go live.

Jane: One more thing - I'll coordinate with the DevOps team about the deployment timeline.

Speaker 1: Perfect. Let's wrap up. Thanks everyone for the updates!
